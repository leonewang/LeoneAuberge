<p><code>fitness:zhihu.com</code></p>
<p>This will search for all content about fitness, but only on zhihu.com. All other search results will be removed. If you need to find specific content on a particular site, this is the shortcut you can use.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="Use-quotes-for-precise-search"><a href="#Use-quotes-for-precise-search" class="headerlink" title="Use quotes for precise search"></a>Use quotes for precise search</h2><p>When searching for something specific, try using quotes to minimize the guesswork for Google search. When you put your search parameters in quotes, it tells the search engine to search for the whole phrase. For instance, if you search for Google research scholar, the engine will search for content that contains those three words in any order, that means Google search pages will show you the results which contain Google scholar research, scholar research Google, scholar Google research and so on. However, if you search “Google research scholar”, it will search for that phrase exactly as you typed it. This can help locate specific information that may be buried under other content if not sorted out correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Use-the-asterisk-wildcard-for-fuzzy-search"><a href="#Use-the-asterisk-wildcard-for-fuzzy-search" class="headerlink" title="Use the asterisk wildcard for fuzzy search"></a>Use the asterisk wildcard for fuzzy search</h2><p>The asterisk wildcard is the most useful tip. What is asterisk wildcard? Asterisk wildcard is a “all-powerful” word that you can use it to replace any word that you don’t know. When you use an asterisk in a search term on Google search, it will leave a placeholder that may be automatically filled by the search engine later. This is a brilliant way to find song lyrics if you don’t know all the words. For example, If you are not sure the lyrics in a song (maybe you only remember a few words), you can just type this words with asterisk in the input box to find the lyric.</p>
<p><code>My broken * you * them up</code></p>
<p>To you or me, that looks like nonsense. However, Google search will search for that phrase knowing that the asterisk can be any word. More often than not, you’ll find they are lyrics to Maroon 5 song “Sugar” and that’s what the search will tell you.</p>
<h2 id="Search-for-multiple-words-at-once"><a href="#Search-for-multiple-words-at-once" class="headerlink" title="Search for multiple words at once"></a>Search for multiple words at once</h2><p>Google search is flexible. It knows you may not find what you want by searching only a single word or phrase. Thus, it lets you search for multiples. By using this trick, you can search for one word or phrase along with a second word or phrase. This can help narrow down your search to help you find exactly what you’re looking for. Here is the syntax.</p>
<p><code>“Best ways to prepare for a job interview” OR “How to prepare for a job interview”</code></p>
<p>By searching that, you will search both phrases. Remember the quotes tip above? It’s being used here as well. In this instance, these two exact phrases will be searched. It can be done by word too, like the example below.</p>
<p><code>chocolate OR white chocolate</code></p>
<p>This will search for pages that have either chocolate or white chocolate!</p>
<h2 id="Search-a-range-of-numbers"><a href="#Search-a-range-of-numbers" class="headerlink" title="Search a range of numbers"></a>Search a range of numbers</h2><p>Searching for a range of number is another tip we don’t anticipate a lot of people using. The people that do use it, though, will probably use it quite a bit. People interested in money or statistics will find this tip particularly useful. Essentially, you use two dots and a number to let Google search know you’re looking for a specific range of numbers. Like the syntax below.</p>
<p><code>What teams have won the world cup ..2014
41..43</code></p>
<p>In the first instance, the search will toss back the team that won the World Cup in 2014. The two dots with only one number will tell the search that you don’t need anything before or after 2014. This can help narrow down searches to a specific number to improve search results. In the second, Google will search for the numbers 41, 42, and 43. It is obscure, but wildly useful if you happen to need to search for numbers like this.</p>
<h2 id="Find-a-specific-type-of-file"><a href="#Find-a-specific-type-of-file" class="headerlink" title="Find a specific type of file"></a>Find a specific type of file</h2><p>An often forgotten feature of Google search is the ability to search for a specific file or file type. This can be infinitely useful if you need a specific PDF or PowerPoint file that you previously viewed or need to use for another project. The syntax is quite simple.</p>
<p><code>*Search term here* filetype:pdf</code></p>
<p>In the above example, you simply replace the search term with whatever you’re searching for. Then use the filetype command and enter the extension of any file type you can think of. This can mostly be useful for scholarly purposes, but business presentations and other assorted presentations can benefit from this kind of search as well.</p>
<h2 id="Use-important-words-only"><a href="#Use-important-words-only" class="headerlink" title="Use important words only"></a>Use important words only</h2><p>The way Google search works is to take what you search for and match it with keywords in online content. When you search for too many words, it may limit your results. That means it may actually take you longer to find what you’re looking for. Thus, it is apropos to use only the important words when searching for something. Let’s see an example.</p>
<p><em>Don’t use:</em> <code>Where can I find a Chinese restaurant that delivers</code>.<br><em>Instead try:</em> <code>Chinese restaurants nearby</code>.<br><em>Or:</em> <code>Chinese restaurants near me</code>.</p>
<p>Doing this can help Google find what you need without all the clutter. So remember, keep it simple and use important words only.</p>
