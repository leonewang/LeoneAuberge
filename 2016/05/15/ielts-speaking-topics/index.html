<p><strong>Q: Do you like history?</strong><br><strong>Leone:</strong> Yes,I find history very interesting. Its always engaging to learn some historical stories and learn some knowledge at the same time. Also, I believe history is really useful and practical. There are many philosophies and rules that could be reflected in history, which prevent us from making the same mistakes or give us some good examples to refer to.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Q: How do you think about your history classes?</strong><br>  <strong>Leone:</strong> Actually, I enjoyed it. The history classes were pretty interesting and engaging for me. The teacher was very profound and knowledgeable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Do you think history is important?</strong><br><strong>Leone:</strong> Yes, I do believe history is very crucial. History offers a lot of experience for us to learn and you know that it can be a rather broad concept, including historical legacy, relics and history leaves us lots of great tourist attractions to visit. For example, emperors or poets used to live in palaces or houses, which are great architecture worth visiting now.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you think the Internet is a good way to learn about history?</strong><br><strong>Leone:</strong> Well, I believe so. Since the Internet has got rich resources for people to browse. It’s like no matter which historical figures or events you want to find, you could find in the Internet. Besides, it employs sound and visual effects which are more enjoyable and lively for people to learn in a more interactive way.<br><code>However, some of the references are not very academic or authorized.</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Q: Do you think you can learn history from films or TV programs?</strong><br><strong>Leone:</strong> No, it can be adapted or edited to be more entertaining.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: Can you name a person from history whom you would like to learn more about? Why would you like to learn more about him/her?</strong><br><strong>Leone:</strong> There are many great persons in Chinese history. But the one I admire the most is the Emperor Wu from Han Dynasty. I’d like to learn more from him because he’s very wise and intelligent leader who made great deal of policies to promote education and relieve the tax burden during his 54 years reign.<br><code>At the same time, he&#39;s very versatile person who was so talented in literature and Chinese ink painting.</code></p>
